        <p>You're responsible for <strong>requirements</strong>. Maybe you’re a <strong>business analyst</strong>. Perhaps that’s one of the roles you play. Your organization is starting an <strong>agile journey</strong>. Or maybe it’s already underway.</p>

        <p>Whatever the case may be, <strong>something doesn’t feel right</strong>. You’re doing the things that were easy to change. What about the <strong>hard stuff</strong>? Some of these changes are <strong>out of your control</strong>, but there’s one thing above all you’re concerned with: <strong>Requirements</strong>.</p>

        <p>You have <strong>questions</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>When should I update the requirements?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What do the business requirements look like?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>How do we keep track of requirements traceability?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>What do I do when the requirements change?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Is my role still the same?</strong></li>
