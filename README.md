This is the repo for http://perezish.com. My blog where I add some notes on learning Ruby and all the other related things.

## Site Setup

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as the CMS.
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) for the responsive grid and base styles.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to DRY out the CSS.
* The site is hosted on Amazonâ€™s AWS S3.
