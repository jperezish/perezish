h1. Notes on Learning

Apparently writing about what you learn while you're learning it is a great way to reinforce what you're learning. Well... I have yet to do that. I've been learning "Ruby programming language":www.ruby-lang.org" for the last few months and now's as good a time as any to start writing as I learn. Nothing fancy or long (hopefully). Just a nice, less currated, more barfed out thoughts sort of thing. All in the name of learning and sharing. So here it is. I'll also backfill some topics I picked up in the past.

Most of the notes will cover the Ruby language but, on the road to becomming a well rounded Ruby craftsman, there are plenty of adjacent topics to learn (like testing, javascipt, HTML/CSS, git, rails, db's, continuous integration, etc.).

My hope is that these learning notes will help me stay motivated to write. Sometimes it does feel rather easy to just focus on the code. So instead of listening to mainly "Thoughtbot's Giant Robots":http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots and "Ruby Rogues":http://rubyrogues.com/ podcasts (yes "there":http://5by5.tv/changelog "are":http://www.freelancersshow.com/ "others":http://www.wideteams.com/ I listen too as well) on my ride in to work, I added "Back To Work":5by5.tv/b2w "back to work podcast" _back_ into the mix of podcasts. Music has its place as well. So does silence.
