Me learning Ruby, so far it's been like this:

Do online ruby things, install Ruby, do the Hartl Tutorial, do a lot more tutorials, listen to Ruby Rogues (and not understand most of the topics), read some of the books they recommend, learn about OO, continue to do more tutorials, focus more and more on just Ruby (not Rails), try to write a gem (and get confused by design decisions), visit a local meetup, keep hacking away at the gem (referencing all the things).

I've recently had an epiphany. I can't be lone island man learning on my lonely island. I need to decrease the go off and research the topic feedback loop. So I looked around and came across Ruby Off Rails.
