h1. Setting Expectations

I just submitted the "Salesman Traveler":https://github.com/jperezish/Episode7 assignment for "Ruby Off Rails":https://rubyoffrails.com/. This assignemt starts with an already working app that finds the best route from a list of stops on a sales person's trip. It uses the "Ruby Geocoder gem":http://www.rubygeocoder.com/ to return lat long form a city/state. 

- Add the ability to specify the starting point of the route
- Add some benchmarking code to see how long it takes to calculate routes with 2, 10, 50, and 200 stops.
- Add ability to track the total miles for the route
- Add the ability to track the total duration of the route

My main take away from this had to do with the refactoring of the initial code and identifying the correct messages to send to the correct collaborators. 

h2. So I guess you should listen to your tests

The tests didn't feel right. I've heard this said a bunch of times that the tests will tell you. I now see as I'm writing more and more code what this means.

h2. any_instance can be a code smell
