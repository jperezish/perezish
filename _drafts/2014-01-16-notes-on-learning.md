## Notes on Learning

One of the things I probably should've started sooner was some sort of quick note content on what I've learned so far (I've been learning the [Ruby programming language](www.ruby-lang.org "ruby programming language site")). Just a nice, less currated, more barfed out thoughts sort of thing. All in the name of learning and sharing and stuff. So here it is. I'll start by going back and reviewing things from the past.

I'm learning Ruby so most of the notes will cover the language but, on the road to becomming a good well rounded craftsman, there are plenty of adjacent topics to learn. for instance:
- javascript
- HTML/CSS
- GIT
- 

Speaking of motivation. I'm hoping these learning notes will help me stay motivated to write. Sometimes it does feel rather easy to just focus on the code. So instead of listening to the Thoughtbot and Ruby Rogues podcasts on my ride in, I've added [Back To Work](5by5.tv/b2w "back to work podcast") _back_ into the mix.
