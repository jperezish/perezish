        <p class="lead-in">My name is Jason. I&#8217;ve been in the role of Business Analyst for over 10 years now.</p>

        <p>I didn&#8217;t set out to be a Business Analyst. In fact, I was initially a fine arts major. I like drawing pictures and thought it&#8217;d be cool to draw illustrations for a living&#8230; but things change, and I switched to a general business major.</p>

      I've always enjoyed solving the tough problems thrown my way as an analyst. There are patterns that are predictable, but there's always enough variability to keep it interesting. It's a bit like solving a puzzle.

    <h2>Why this site?</h2>

    <p>One day I was listening to the <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/">Back to Work</a> podcast, <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/7">episode #7: Vocational Wheel</a> and <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a> started talking about some advice he received at a young age from his uncle (around the 42nd minute mark):</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://5by5.tv/b2w/7">
      <p>The best thing you can do (for your career) is get a liberal arts degree (i.e. a basic college education) plus some kind of a technical skill.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This really struck a cord with me and I feel like this technical skill piece is a big deal. On one hand you have the degree, which will teach you to communicate and show that you can finish things. Then you pair that with something like programming and, well, you can do quite a bit with that. Then I thought &#8220;Dude, I don&#8217;t have a technical skill.&#8221; Although I&#8217;ve been creating web apps for years now in a modeling and design capacity, I&#8217;ve never contributed to a project as a programmer. I&#8217;ve never created any code. To me that&#8217;s the real work product. Sure all of that intermediary work of modeling and prototyping gets you to the code, but the code that manifests itself as a product for a user is at the crux of it all.
    </p>

    <p>I intend to write about learning Ruby and the web application framework Ruby on Rails, and what this all means to me and my background as a Business Analyst and, more importantly, as someone who likes to create things.</p>
