  How do you know if you're creating the right application? Yes, we've heard the advice to talk to your customers. It's great advice. But how do you do that? What about when you're creating applications for stakeholders internal to an organization. Would you take a different approach? 
</p>

Let's look at one thing that good product people do and apply that to applications internal to an organization. Is the best approach to just jump in and start asking questions? Well, that might work. But there are a lot of things that _might_ work. Let's take a look at some activities that are the same whether you're working on an internal business application or a product for a customer.

h2. Differences in internal and external applications

We started out last time getting to know our potential customers by breaking them into segments. We did this initially by roles in they play in our survivor pool. This wasn't done randomly. We interviewed some people and gathered data. We let that data guide us.

Maybe you don't create products for customers. Maybe you're a Business Analyst and you work on systems that are supporting internal business functions in your organzation. You may wonder how that product stuff applies to you.

Let's explore this.

The first thing you want to do is get at your audience. Who are they and what do they want? A product developed for a market needs a different approach to get to their customers versus a product created for stakeholders internal to a business. Take a look at this:

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/people_you_work_with.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a diagram showing that all of the stakeholders are internal to this particluar organization." title="This should be easy, right?" />
</div>

As you can see from this simplistic diagram all of the people you need to get to are in your organization! Nice! What's that you say? You have 2000 people in your company in three different locations across your country?

Hmmm... well hold that thought as we look at the case of someone creating an application for an external market:

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/the_users_dont_work_with_me.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a diagram showing that all of the potential users are external to this particluar organization." title="This should be harder, right?" />
</div>

<div class="small-12 columns">

The truth is, even thought the starting points are different, both situations require research into who is going to use the applications. One factor, of course, is the size of your market/organization.

</div>

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/web_app_or_spreadsheet.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a chart showing that the more people that have a similar problem, the greater the potential need for a system." title="What if they don't need a system to fix the problem?" />
</div>

The smaller it is, the less likely the need for any sort of application to begin with.

Form over function. You can say that this is a differentiating factor in internal vs external applications. We can't make this statement
But it doesn't change the needs. Both have to solve a real need in order to be successful.

Let's define a stakeholder as anyone with an interest in the actions you're undertaking.

h2. Stakeholders is people! Market is people!

The primary goal we should be focused on here is helping people solve problems. Let's not focus on whether we're calling those people stakeholders or a market segment. Let's also not focus on whether we're providing these people with a system or product. Let's then focus on the people, their problem, and a solution for their problem.

classify and identify the different types of people.
