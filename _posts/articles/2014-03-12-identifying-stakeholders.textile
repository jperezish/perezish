  How do you know if you're creating the right application? Yes, we know we should to talk to our customers. But how do you do that? Is that the first step? What about when you're creating applications for stakeholders internal to an organization. Would you take a different approach?
</p>

Let's just dive in and start asking people questions? That works, right? Well, that might work. But there are a lot of things that _might_ work. Let's take a look at some common activities. These activities apply to internal business application and products.

h2. business application vs. product

Last time we got to know our potential customers by  breaking them into "audience segments":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_segmentation. We did this by the roles(e.g. Pool Manager, Pool Player) they play in our survivor pool. This wasn't done in random way. We interviewed some people and gathered data. We let that data guide us. Roles can be a good, quick way to create initial segments of your users.

Maybe you don't create products for customers. Maybe you're a Business Analyst. You work on systems that support internal business functions in your organization. You may wonder how that product stuff applies to you.

Let's explore this. For the sake of this example we'll assume that we will create some sort of application in both cases below.

You're a Business Analyst. You're presented with a business problem. The first thing you want to do is identify all your stakeholders. Who are they and how are they involved in this problem? Since this app is internal to our organization we should have an easy time identifying the stakeholders. We know where they work and we can just talk to them!

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/people_you_work_with.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a diagram showing that all of the stakeholders are internal to this particluar organization." title="This should be easy, right?" />
</div>

As you can see from this simplistic diagram, the people you need to talk to are in your organization! Nice! This should be easy then. What's that you say? You have 2000 people in your company in three different locations across the country? There's an internal political struggle between two of the departments involved? One of the primary subject matter experts quit last week?

Hmmm... well hold those thoughts as we look at the case of a Product Manager creating a product for an external market.

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/the_users_dont_work_with_me.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a diagram showing that all of the potential users are external to this particluar organization." title="This should be harder, right?" />
</div>

<div class="small-12 columns">

Yes. It takes quite a bit of work trying to understand the problems of your potential customers. It's even harder if you go about it starting with a product first.

The truth is, even though the starting points are different, both situations require research into who is going to use the solution. One factor, of course, is the size of your market/organization.

</div>

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/web_app_or_spreadsheet.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a chart showing that the more people that have a similar problem, the greater the potential need for a system." title="What if they don't need a system to fix the problem?" />
</div>

The smaller it is, the less likely the need for any sort of application to begin with.

Form over function. You can say that this is a differentiating factor in internal vs external applications. We can't make this statement
But it doesn't change the needs. Both have to solve a real need in order to be successful.

Let's define a stakeholder as anyone with an interest in the actions you're undertaking.

h2. Stakeholders is people! Market is people!

The primary goal we should be focused on here is helping people solve problems. Let's not focus on whether we're calling those people stakeholders or a market segment. Let's also not focus on whether we're providing these people with a system or product. Let's then focus on the people, their problem, and a solution for their problem.

classify and identify the different types of people.

h2. So back to the questions

How do you know if you're creating the right application?

How do you talk with the customers?

Is that the first step?

Would you take a different approach for business app vs product?
