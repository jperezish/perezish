<p class="lead-in">
  How do you know if you're creating the right application? Yes, we should to talk to our customers. But how do you do that? Is that the first step? What about when you're creating applications for stakeholders internal to an organization. Would you take a different approach?
</p>

Let's just dive in and start asking people questions. That works, right? Well, that might work. But there are a lot of things that _might_ work. Let's take a look at some common activities. These activities apply to internal business applications as well as digital products (e.g. "SaaS applications":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service).

h2. business application vs. digital product

Quick note on terms. Let's define a digital product as a product that requires no raw materials in the production of the product. So we're talking about software more than we're talking about finished goods like a toothbrush. Let's define a stakeholder as a person with a vested interest in the actions you're undertaking.

Last time we learned more about our potential customers. We separated them into "audience segments":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_segmentation. We did this by the roles(e.g. Pool Manager, Pool Player) they play in our survivor pool. This wasn't done in a random way. We interviewed some people and gathered data. We let that data guide us. Roles can be a good, quick way to create initial segments of your users.

For the sake of this example we'll assume that we will create some sort of application in both cases below.

h3. you're a business analyst

Maybe you don't create products for customers outside your organization. Maybe you're a Business Analyst. You work on systems that support internal business functions in your organization. You may wonder how that product stuff applies to you.

As a Business Analyst, you're working with a group of users and notice a business problem. You take your time to better understand the problem and get the go ahead to explore the greater impact. The first thing you want to do is identify all your stakeholders. Who are they and how are they involved in this problem? Since this app is internal to your organization you won't have to hunt down all the stakeholders.

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/people_you_work_with.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a diagram showing that all of the stakeholders are internal to this particluar organization." title="This should be easy, right?" />
</div>

As you can see from this simplistic diagram, the people you need to talk to are in your organization! Nice! This should be easy then. What's that you say? You have 2000 people in your company in three different locations across the country? Some of the vocal, opinionated groups are volunteering unsolicited information every day. But it seems like you're missing a silent contingent that doesn't want to change. Wait, what's that now? There's an internal political struggle between two of the departments involved? One of the primary subject matter experts quit last week?

Hmmm... well hold those thoughts as we look at the case of a Product Manager creating a product for an external market.

h3. you're a product manager

As a Product Manager, you're working at a product company and notice a new market segment. You do some initial research. You discover where that group has their "digital water coolers" (e.g. blogs, niche social networks). Now you need to find potential customers in this new market.

<div class="small-12 small-centered columns">
  <img src="/images/the_users_dont_work_with_me.png" class="align-center" alt="A picture of a diagram showing that all potential customers are external to this organization." title="This should be harder, right?" />
</div>

<div class="small-12 columns">

Well this problem is a little different than that of the business analyst. Here the product manager needs figure out how to get to even just one, single, potential customer. But that won't be enough to make decisions.

Both the business analyst and the product manager need to better understand their audience. They both start with the same goal.

We can see that the starting points are different. But both situations need research into who is going to use the solution.

</div>

h2. Stakeholders is people! Market is people!

The primary goal is to identify the right people for what we want to do right now. We may refer to groups of these people as stakeholders, market segments, or potential customers.

There is a point in comparing and contrasting the business analyst and the digital product manager. The point is to create an awareness that the two roles are more similar than they're different. The reason for doing this is to continue to learn and get better at what we do. Each discipline in the creation of applications can learn from the tools and techniques used in others.

h2. So back to the questions

How do you talk with the customers?

Is that the first step?

Would you take a different approach for business app vs product?

The first question at the beginning asked how do you know if you're creating the right application? We didn't get an answer to that. We haven't learned enough about the people yet. Next time we'll get another step closer.
